# All custom scripts used for the production of Fig5 and Extended Data Fig 5

## Fig5G_heatmap_DEGS_go_intersect.R
This script takes an input of GO (gene ontology) terms and DEGs between celltypes of interest. It returns the intersect between genes associated with the terms and DEGs between celltype groups of interest and plots a heatmap of the intersecting genes ranked by log fold change computed in differential expression testing.

NOTE: for reproducibility, we encourage to use post-quality control (postQC) raw files available on GEO, as the pre-QC files in bone marrow samples should be demultiplexed with Souporcell to separate the fetal bone marrow cells of interest, from those adult bone marrow cells. For this tissue, we run Souporcell using their singularity and --common_variants COMMON_VARIANTS.

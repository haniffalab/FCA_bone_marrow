Fig6G_heatmap_pathway_score.r
This script takes an output from "/pipeline_scripts/pipeline_Gene_set_over_representation_analysis.R" and produces a heatmap ranking the top n pathway module clusters by markov cluster size and plots a heatmap ranking these clusters by log fold change of the genes associated with each cluster.
